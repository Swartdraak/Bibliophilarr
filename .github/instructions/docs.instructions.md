# Documentation Custom Instructions

## Scope

These instructions apply to Markdown documentation.

## Documentation Intent

- Keep docs aligned with Bibliophilarr's migration mission: FOSS metadata providers, reliability, and sustainability.
- Prefer actionable, operationally useful docs over abstract descriptions.

## Writing Standards

- Use clear headings and task-oriented structure.
- Include prerequisites, commands, expected outcomes, and troubleshooting notes.
- Explicitly call out assumptions, risks, and known limitations.
- Link related docs to maintain navigability across roadmap/status/plans.

## Change Management

When updating docs for a behavior change, include:

1. What changed
2. Why it changed
3. How to validate it
4. Operational impact and rollback/mitigation notes

## DevOps/CI-CD Emphasis

- Encourage iterative cycles (plan → implement → verify → document).
- Document test strategy and pipeline expectations for each significant initiative.
- Keep runbooks and checklists current with actual repository workflows.
