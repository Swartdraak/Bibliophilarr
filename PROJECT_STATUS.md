## What Needs to Be Done 📋

### Current Focus: Phase 2 Infrastructure (60% Remaining)

#### Provider Registry Implementation ⏳
- [ ] Create MetadataProviderRegistry service class
- [ ] Implement provider priority and selection logic
- [ ] Add provider enable/disable functionality
- [ ] Create provider health monitoring service
- [ ] Add configuration system for provider settings
- [ ] Implement dependency injection setup

#### Testing Framework ⏳
- [ ] Create base test class for provider implementations
- [ ] Add mock HTTP client for testing
- [ ] Create test fixtures with sample metadata
- [ ] Add integration test utilities
- [ ] Write unit tests for MetadataQualityScorer
- [ ] Write tests for aggregation logic
- [ ] Document testing patterns and examples

#### Monitoring & Logging ⏳
- [ ] Add structured logging for provider operations
- [ ] Create provider performance metrics
- [ ] Add error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Create provider health check endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limit tracking and warnings

### Phase 1 Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Community engagement and recruitment
- [ ] Set up Discord or communication channel
- [ ] Create GitHub project board for task tracking
- [ ] Set up continuous integration for documentation

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Design provider interface v2
- [ ] Implement provider registry
- [ ] Build metadata quality scorer
- [ ] Create testing framework
- [ ] Set up monitoring/logging

### Phase 3: Open Library Provider (Weeks 9-14)
- [ ] Implement Open Library API client
- [ ] Map Open Library data to Bibliophilarr models
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] ISBN/ASIN lookup
- [ ] Author information retrieval
- [ ] Cover image handling
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

### Subsequent Phases
See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for complete phase breakdown.

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture
1. **Multi-provider approach** with fallback and aggregation
2. **Open Library as primary provider** due to size, license, and features
3. **Inventaire as secondary** for additional coverage
4. **Google Books as tertiary fallback** for critical gaps
5. **ISBN as primary external identifier** (more universal than provider-specific IDs)

### Database
1. **Extend existing schema** rather than complete rewrite
2. **Add multiple identifier columns** for each provider
3. **Maintain Goodreads IDs** for backward compatibility during migration
4. **Create mapping table** for ID resolution

### Migration Strategy
1. **Gradual migration** - not forced on users immediately
2. **Multiple ID mapping strategies** (ISBN from files, title/author matching, etc.)
3. **User control** - allow manual overrides and provider selection
4. **Backward compatibility** - support existing Goodreads-based libraries

### Quality Assurance
1. **Metadata quality scoring** to compare provider results
2. **Multi-provider aggregation** for best possible metadata
3. **User reporting tools** for metadata issues
4. **Community contribution** pathways

## Current Challenges

### Technical
- Rate limiting with Open Library (100 req/5min default)
- ISBN mapping for existing Goodreads-based libraries
- Handling books without ISBNs
- Series information (less robust in Open Library)
- Metadata quality variance

### Community
- Need contributors, especially C# developers
- Need beta testers with various library sizes
- Documentation needs ongoing maintenance
- Community communication channels needed

### Timeline
- Ambitious 30+ week timeline
- Dependent on volunteer contributions
- May need adjustment based on resources
